This is a system that tells people the day of the week they were born using Ghananian names.
Naming according to days of the week as is the mode of naming in some parts of Ghana, we will be using this system to easily tell the weekday any person who knows their day of birth was born
Terms and conditions apply. Any person may use this system to know their day of birth as long as you know your date of Birth. 
Please note that it tells the day one was born not really the date which one was born.
